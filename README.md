pubpeer-for-zotero
==================

Zotero extension that provides PubPeer content.

This extension is still in development and all code currently resides
in a dedicated [development branch](https://github.com/pubpeer-for-zotero/pubpeer-for-zotero/tree/development).
Once the extension is usable the development branch will be merged
with the master branch to prepare for release of the extension.

The development branch [can be found here](https://github.com/pubpeer-for-zotero/pubpeer-for-zotero/tree/development).
